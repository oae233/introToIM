### Description:
For this project I had an RGB LED light. I had 3 buttons, a yellow one that would turn the LED yellow, a purple one that would turn it purple, and a button with a color wheel image that makes the LED shift along the color wheel. Additionally I have 3 LED lights, red, blue, and green that light up at different intensities that reflect their percentage in the produced color. Originally I had a plan to add buttons which the user could use to control the RGB values of the RGB led, decreaising or increasing them by increments of 10, producing any desired color.
